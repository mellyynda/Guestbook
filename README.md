# [Guestbook](https://mellyynda.github.io/Guestbook/) is a project built for KYH Yrkesh√∂gskola - Front End Developer Education Program.

It is a browser based program that allows the user to add participants to specific events directly from his computer or mobile device. It does not have a backend hence it only saves data to the browser's local storage.
